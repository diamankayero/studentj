# What is QWER?

[QWER](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER) is a blog starter and static site generator, built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

::: warning

QWER is currently in `alpha` status. Kindly expect breaking changes between minor releases. It is funtional and work out-of-the-box for technical blog. However, it has not yet tested for high volume of posts (eg. > 100) and it might not be suitable for it as for now.

It's a project for learning Svelte and for fun. We hope you will enjoy taking it apart and build your own solution.

## Motivation

It's my belief that in order to be an awesome developer, writing ability is one of the keys. As a developer, writing helps me reinforce what I have learned. Also, it helps me better communicate with other people and reach more people. Thus, I started to write blogs not long ago to keep track of my journey as a developer.

At the beginning, I used blog starters developed by other people. I tried a few, but was not fully satisfied. A few months ago, I came across [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). The simplicity and outstanding performance caught my eyes. I decided to learn them and use them to develop my own blog starter.

[QWER](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER) was originally inspired by [Urara](https://github.com/importantimport/urara) - another blog starter built with SvelteKit. You can check my previous blog generated by [Urara](https://github.com/importantimport/urara): [urara.kwchang0831.dev](https://urara.kwchang0831.dev/). And, here is my current blog generated by [QWER](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER): [kwchang0831.dev](https://www.kwchang0831.dev)

It is my first time developing project using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). I had a lot of fun building [QWER](https://github.com/kwchang0831/svelte-QWER) while learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). However, I wrote a lot of shitcodes ðŸ’© inside it , even though it is functioning. You have been warned. Be caution when you start reading my codebase ðŸ˜‚.
