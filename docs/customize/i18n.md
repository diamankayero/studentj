# i18n for QWER

QWER utlizes [typesafe-i18n](https://github.com/ivanhofer/typesafe-i18n), a fully type-safe and lightweight internationalization library, for UI display language translation.

The base locale is **English**, and includes the following translations:

- Japanese
- Tranditional Chinese
- Simplified Chinese

## Change locale

Update `siteConfig.lang` in `user/config/site.ts`. If the lang is includes in `src/i18n` then the translation will be applied, otherwise the default `English` locale is used.

## Add new locale

Add your translation under `src/i18n`. Check out other language translation for example.
